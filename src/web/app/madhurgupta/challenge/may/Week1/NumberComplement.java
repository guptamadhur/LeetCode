/*
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

        Example 1:

        Input: 5
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

        Example 2:

        Input: 1
        Output: 0
        Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

        Note:

        The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
        You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
        This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
